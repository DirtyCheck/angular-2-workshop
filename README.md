## Introduction

This repository accompanies the 23/09/2016 Wix Engineering workshop for Students, Ukraine: 

Together, we're going to build a very simple app that exposes us to the most basic 
things in Angular 2.0
together and leave some for you to try on your own. 

Every step has an accompanying branch in this repo that contains all of the code for the tasks up to (and including)
that step. If necessary, you can check out a step's branch to see a potential solution
or to skip to a later step.
